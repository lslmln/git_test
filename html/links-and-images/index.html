    <p>The rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.</p>
    <p>noopener: The noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk.</p> 
    <p>noreferrer: The noreferrer value of the rel attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original page.</p>

    <p>Then why do people still use both? Explicit is better than implicit.
    Developers want to signal both intentions clearly: security and privacy.</p>

    <!-- This is a relative link, within the same domain. -->
    <!-- Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory. -->
